COMMENT                        -------------------------
COMMENT  This header has been developed for test purposes and as such contains
COMMENT  all standard WCS keywords.  Combining certain of them (e.g. PCi_ja,
COMMENT  CDi_ja, and CROTAn) within a single FITS header violates certain WCS
COMMENT  standards.  However, taken individually, each representation is legal,
COMMENT  except as indicated.
COMMENT
COMMENT  The three alternate representations define essentially the same
COMMENT  coordinate system in three different ways.  The older AIPS convention
COMMENT  is necessarily used for the primary representation because the
COMMENT  alternate version code (e.g. the "a" in CTYPEia) is not applicable in
COMMENT  that convention.
COMMENT
COMMENT  For compatibility testing, the header also contains a number of non-
COMMENT  standard keywords and constructs: the AIPS keywords CROTAn, EPOCH, and
COMMENT  VELREF retrofitted with alternate version codes, and PROJPn, a
COMMENT  forerunner of PVi_ma.  However, non-standard CD00i00j and PC00i00j
COMMENT  keywords, while recognized, are not included since they can only apply
COMMENT  to the primary representation which is used here to test the AIPS
COMMENT  convention.
COMMENT
COMMENT  A simple TAN projection used in the primary representation is
COMMENT  expressed as an equivalent SZP projection in the "A" representation,
COMMENT  and approximated by a ZPN in the "I" representation.  A bulk image
COMMENT  rotation of 15 deg applied by the defunct CROTAn keyword in the AIPS
COMMENT  convention is replaced in the alternates by an equivalent bulk image
COMMENT  rotation of 30 deg applied by the linear transformation matrix,
COMMENT  together with an effective bulk rotation of -15 deg applied by
COMMENT  LONPOLE (this is only possible for zenithal projections).
COMMENT
COMMENT  Similarly, the spectral axis in the primary representation, a simple
COMMENT  linear frequency axis, is recast as non-linear wavelength and redshift
COMMENT  axes in the alternates.
COMMENT
COMMENT  Although the parser handles free-format character string, integer, and
COMMENT  floating-point keyvalues (NOST 100-2.0, Sect. 5.2) most numeric values
COMMENT  in this header are given in the conventional fixed-format, with only
COMMENT  CROTA2I, EPOCHI, and VELREFI as exceptions for testing.  Most string
COMMENT  values are free-format, only those in the "A" representation are fixed.

COMMENT  =======================================================================
COMMENT  Primary representation
COMMENT  ----------------------
COMMENT
COMMENT  In the AIPS convention CROTAn associated with the latitude axis
COMMENT  defines a bulk image rotation.  Strictly speaking, the representation
COMMENT  here is illegal since it mixes new WCS keywords (WCSAXESa and
COMMENT  WCSNAMEa) with CROTAn, an older AIPS convention keyword.  WCSAXES is
COMMENT  used here because setting NAXIS non-zero would require that this FITS
COMMENT  file contain a data section.
COMMENT
COMMENT  Several PROJPn keyrecords (non-standard) are also included here for
COMMENT  test purposes; they were never part of the AIPS convention and only
COMMENT  appeared in early drafts of the WCS papers.  Their values are not
COMMENT  actually used in the TAN projection.

COMMENT  keywords are included for informational purposes only and otherwise
COMMENT  are to be ignored.
COMMENT
COMMENT  Strictly speaking, alternate version codes are not defined for CROTAn
COMMENT  (e.g. CROTA2I below), EPOCHa or VELREFa.  The latter two should be

COMMENT
COMMENT  While encoding a TAN projection as SZP may be good for testing
